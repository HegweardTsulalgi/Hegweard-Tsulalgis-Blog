Hi, My name is Jack. This site has been made in my free time, I oringally made it using Pure [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) until a friend of mine recommended i use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) just because of how much easier it is then pure [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS). She kindly ported over my website to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for me. Now I plan on using this website just for fun things im interested in! Such as Photography, DND, Writing, Retro Computing, Retro PC Hardware, Gaming, Emulation, And Content Creation.

I plan on posting a blog post whenever i want too as this is just a fun hobby i have decided to try due to me having a good amount of free time in my life, Wanting to try and spend it on something meaningful!
