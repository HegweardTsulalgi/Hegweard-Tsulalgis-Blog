Ladybird is an independent
Web Browser made by Andreas Kling. I have been interested in due to how monopolized the web space has become. Ladybird breaks the mold by being a brand new browser, Not being based on any other browsers.[^3] The browser is supported by a non-profit that's funned exclusively by donations without any corporate deals or revenue outside of unrestricted donations.[^4] Which is fairly unheard of in the browser space. I will show you Ladybird and my opinions on it's early alpha

# My First impressions

Launching Ladybird you will see the blank homepage, It Kinda reminds me of KDEs Falkon web browser, Whitch isn't a bad thing, I quite like how Falkon looks, It's pretty barebones at this current point.

The browser has a decent amount of features, Most of them are development focused, Such as spoofing your useragent, Dumping Cookies, Debug infomation, Etc Etc. I may mess around with these features if i can get a working build that works properly online.

Strangely, Pages don't load and are stuck on a white screen, I have tried a load of websites and none seem to work, My suspicion is that it's because of the build I'm using, I'm using a pre-compiled Flatpak from their Actions page.

However Ladybird works using my local test envierment i use for debugging my blog, Everything is pretty fast (It's local so that's a given) everything renders pretty well, It's a bit insane how much such a small team could accomplish within a few years. Andreas Kling made a post on X october 2025 stating that Ladybird has passed 90% web tests meaning it's now eligible to be an alternative browser engine on iOS.[^2]

# Closing thoughts

Ladybird is a very intresting project, I have been keeping a close eye on it for the last few years, Ladybird looks promising as a brand new browser base, I will be excited for when it releases it's first alpha. As this is right now a pre-alpha, If you want to have some fun, You should check it out if you are intrested in the browser space or if you are a web dev, I had quite a lot of fun taking a look at Ladybird
